I feel incredibly alone right now. There isn’t helped by the fact that my phone carrier is broken and I can’t receive or make phone calls asides from SOS phone calls maybe the people at 911 are lonely and want somebody to talk to.

I think I’m just gonna stay up all night tonight. Sleep doesn’t seem to be helping.

The reality is nothing seems to be helping.

I just want…

Sigh…

Words are garbage.

Even on this blog that is supposed to be an entirely me centered experience I feel selfish saying what I actually feel.

Also, if I say it out loud, it makes it real.

I think I’m hoping beyond hope that at least some person taps the heart on Tumblr.

I mean part of me is just like hoping that maybe some bot somewhere accidentally or is programmed to inflate likes and gives one of my posts a single heart.

I have no expectation of ever going viral on any platform ever.

But just knowing that at least some person or some thing visited my page I mean, I guess I counts for something, but it hasn’t happened yet so yeah.(edit thank you )

￼ Boil boy yes boil boy God, I love this technology. It seems to never understand any of what I say ever and just makes me laugh immensely. Oh, I just got a notification from Taylor Swift. Still thinking of you. This is torture. This sucks thinking of investing in shotguns or life insurance. JK sorry to take it to a dark place but if I don’t have a place to take it to a dark place to take it to a dark place to take it to a dark place to Yada yada yada .

I mean, Taylor is right torture and what not …￼
